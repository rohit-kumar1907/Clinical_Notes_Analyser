Dependent Personality Disorder is characterized by extreme dependence on others for praise and guidance, but without the flamboyant, exaggerated, emotional features of individuals with Histrionic Personality Disorder. It is associated with higher rates of somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and major depressive disorder, and often co-occurs with Borderline, Narcissistic, Antisocial, and Dependent Personality Disorders.

b. Using Huggingface embeddings:
Histrionic Personality Disorder is characterised by a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking behaviour, such as being uncomfortable in situations in which they are not the center of attention, interacting with others in a sexually seductive manner, displaying rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions, using physical appearance to draw attention to self, having a style of speech that is impressionistic and lacking in detail, self-dramatisation, suggestibility, and considering relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterised by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy, such as having a grandiose sense of self-importance, being preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, believing they are "special" and unique, requiring excessive admiration, and having a sense of entitlement.
